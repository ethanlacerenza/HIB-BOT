## Description

Your Project Name is a Python-based Telegram chatbot that checks whether an email address or password has been compromised in known data breaches. The chatbot leverages the Have I Been Pwned API to provide users with information about the security of their credentials.

The main features of the project include:
- Checking if an email address has been pwned and displaying the number of times it has appeared in breaches.
- Checking if a password has been pwned and displaying how many times it has been seen in breaches.
- Seamless integration with Telegram for user-friendly interaction.

This project is designed to help users make informed decisions about their online security and take appropriate action if their credentials have been compromised.
